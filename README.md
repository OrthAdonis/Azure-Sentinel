<h1> LIVE CYBER ATTACKS</h1>


The project covers:
Configuring log analytics workspace,
forwarding logs and integrating with Sentinel,
querying failed login attempts and visualizing attack sources,
building an attack map to track real-time hacker activity


<h2>Environbents Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

I set up a virtual machine using Microsoft Azure. From there, I exposed the machine to live traffic. Attackers from all over the world began attempts to hack the virtual machine. I logged this data live and used a map to ping where the attacks were coming from around the world.
